## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `LottieBinding`, the interface to the native Lottie renderer, with its load
  result, info, features bitmask and render job types.
- `testing.dart`: `FakeLottieBinding` and `NativeBindingContract`, which every
  binding runs against itself, including a check that a render stays inside
  its slot.
