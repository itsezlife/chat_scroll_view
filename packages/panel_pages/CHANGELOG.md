# Changelog

All notable changes to `panel_pages` are documented in this file. The format is
loosely based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); this package
is pre-1.0.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `CatalogPage`, the page scaffold: viewport hosting on collections, loading
  and paging as sections come near, search results over a `SearchSource`, pick
  and long-press plumbing, a top strip slot, roving-focus keys, scroll-activity
  reporting to the shell and the bake hand-off.
- `CatalogPagePolicy` for the decisions that depend on the kind of content, and
  `CatalogPageModel` / `CatalogSnapshotBuilder` for the state and the
  collection-to-section mapping behind the widget.
- `BakeActivityPort`, `CatalogBakeForwarder` and `GlyphAtlasBakePort`: the
  catalogue's motion (as one reporter, with union semantics) and its settled
  visible band reach the glyph bake through a narrow port that survives a
  replaced atlas. Replaces the forwarding the old chrome package did.
- `ChromeCatalogTheme`, the single mapping of chrome tokens to the viewport's
  own theme; `PageAssets`, the scope that draws glyphs as text where nothing is
  baked.
- `package:panel_pages/testing.dart` with `FakePanelPageHost`,
  `FakeBakeActivityPort` and `runBakeActivityPortContract`.
