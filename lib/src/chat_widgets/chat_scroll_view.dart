/// | null      | `dirty` / `fetching` | Fetch in flight | Shimmer / loading skeleton |
/// | null      | `absent` | Permanently absent (server confirmed; e.g. deleted batch) | `SizedBox.shrink()` |
/// | null      | `valid`  | Should not occur after absent-slot marking; treat as absent for defensive compatibility | `SizedBox.shrink()` |
///

/// contribute no height, so the scrollbar position stays proportional to real

/// O(chunk) time, so this builder is not normally invoked for them — but it
/// MAY be called if the absent-marking pass has not yet run (e.g. during the
/// first frame before the first fetch completes).
///
/// **Lint**: [ChatMessageStatus] is an `extension type` over `int` — a raw
/// `int` coerces silently with no runtime error. Use named constants.
///

/// chunk is in error state, this builder is **not** invoked for any id in
